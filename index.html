  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Dr. Faheem Faheem</h2>
    <p>25+ years in mechanical engineering, medical robotics, and product development. Former WPI adjunct professor. AI entrepreneur and real estate strategist. Mentor in faith-based communities. Faheem has a strong background in engineering, with advanced degrees from the University of Colorado, MIT, and Harvard, and specialized training in neuroscience from Duke. He’s spent over two decades designing cutting-edge technologies — from MEMS sensors and wearable health devices to AI-powered systems.

What makes Faheem stand out isn’t just the depth of his education — it’s how he brings that knowledge into real-world solutions. He’s taken tools once built for Air Force pilots and high-end medical systems and is now applying them to help small businesses thrive — like tracking the health of livestock using smart sensors, or automating a coffee shop’s operations using AI.

He’s passionate about using the latest technology — like generative AI and agent-based automation — to build custom solutions quickly, affordably, and with real business impact. Whether it’s a café app, vineyard monitoring, or customer engagement, Faheem focuses on helping owners scale what they do best — and reach the customers they’re currently missing.</p>
